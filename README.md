### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a native mobile developer for over 10 years and have worked on the iOS, Android, and even Windows Phone platforms (yes, I know, it's a bit funny todayðŸ˜„). I am currently working on several projects using Flutter, but unfortunately I cannot share the code here.

In addition to my skills in native mobile development, I also have solid experience in developing shell or python scripts to automate repetitive tasks. I find this to be very useful in optimizing workflow and saving time on repetitive tasks that would otherwise take a lot of time to execute manually.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you want to know more about my background as a mobile developer.
